# Favvychan - Simple calculator

## Welcome!

Thanks for checking out this project.

**This project was created with basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The project

A calculator simply performs mathematical calculations, therefore this app was created to evaluate simple mathematical calculations for the users.

In this app users can perform general calcualations, calculations such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication, and would be able to see the results of the calculation on the screen.

## What I learned

In the making of this app, basic HTML, CSS, and javaScript were used, while reading this code, it will be of notice that the javaSrcipt codes can be found in the html file. This calculator has exposed me to some new codes and how they can be used.
